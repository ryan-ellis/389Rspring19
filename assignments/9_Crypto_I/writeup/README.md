## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (70 Pts)

### Part 2 (30 Pts)

For Part 2, while I have a functional script for matching the first hash I appear to be getting stuck on having the program hang after sending back the first match. I think this has to do with either how I am encoding or how I am transmitting my data. It seems like a fairly simple bug that I am not able to find for some reason.
