## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

* The right flag
* Showing what input you used to obtain the flag.
* Describing your thought process.
* Any suggested precautions v0idcache could implement to prevent this vulnerability?

Flag: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

The first step I took in trying to find the flag, was learning how exactly the server worked. I began by testing basic inputs giving random IP addresses like 192.168.1.1 just so I could see the results. I did a bit of research about command injections and I learned about using the ";" character in order to chain together multiple linux commands to be executed sequentially. I experimented with this by adding on commands to the end of random IP addresses, such as "192.168.1.1;ls". Through this I was able to get a look at the directory and subdirectories. I knew the flag was stored somewhere in the directory about would have the text "CMSC389" somewhere in the file so I wanted to find a way to search for that string in all of the directories. I looked online and found a command called "grep" which could do exactly this. Next I tried "192.168.1.1;grep "CMSC389" ." as an input and I was able to find the location of the file and subsequently use "cat" in order to actually read the contents of the flag. Some precautions that v0idcache may want to look into is making sure they sanitize their input field. This means that they check their input for characters like ";" and make sure to escape the character so it is treated like a string instead of a command. Sanitizing input helps to insure that people cannot use command injection to learn about your survey and it's vulnerabilities.
