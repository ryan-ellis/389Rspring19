## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

* The right flag
* Showing what input you used to obtain the flag.
* Describing your thought process.
* Any suggested precautions v0idcache could implement to prevent this vulnerability?

Flag: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

The first step I took in trying to find the flag, was learning how exactly the server worked. I began by testing basic inputs giving random IP addresses like 192.168.1.1 just so I could see the results. I did a bit of research about command injections and I learned about using the ";" character in order to chain together multiple linux commands to be executed sequentially. I experimented with this by adding on commands to the end of random IP addresses, such as "192.168.1.1;ls". Through this I was able to get a look at the directory and subdirectories. I knew the flag was stored somewhere in the directory about would have the text "CMSC389" somewhere in the file so I wanted to find a way to search for that string in all of the directories. I looked online and found a command called "grep" which could do exactly this. Next I tried "192.168.1.1;grep "CMSC389" ." as an input and I was able to find the location of the file and subsequently use "cat" in order to actually read the contents of the flag. Some precautions that v0idcache may want to look into is making sure they sanitize their input field. This means that they check their input for characters like ";" and make sure to escape the character so it is treated like a string instead of a command. Sanitizing input helps to insure that people cannot use command injection to learn about your survey and it's vulnerabilities.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

For this part the idea was simple, we simply want to execute commands like we did in Part I but this type using the socket library in python instead of the "nc" command directly in the terminal. In order to accomplish this I first had to research how exactly to use the socket library in order to send commands. Upon my research I discovered that you can use the send() method in order to send commands via the socket library. After establishing a connection to the server we can now send commands through the python application instead of directly communicating with the server through the terminal. This is helpful to use because it allows for much more simpler exploitation of Elizabeth's server. Instead of having to reopen the connection manually with the server, we can keep feeding commands to the python application in order to test what happens when certain commands are entered. I could definitely see how this application could be expanded further with more commands and more features. For example, one idea I had while working on this assignment is that I could recursively go through every directory on the server and use the pull command in order to extract every file. This way even if you donâ€™t know what specific file you are after, you can execute the command and have a complete copy of everything on the server on your own computer instantly. This would make discovering vulnerabilities much more efficient than the guess and check style that I used in Part I.
